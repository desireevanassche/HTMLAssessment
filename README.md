# HTML Assessment

## Description
In this project I utilized Atom to begin the process of building a correctly structured HTML document skeleton. This document contains a variety of elements, including section headers, tables, images, URL links, forms, and buttons to create a replica of a page we were instructed to recreate.   

## Technologies Used
* Atom
* Command Line
* Google Chrome
* Structure
* Lists
* Images
* Tables
* Forms

## Lessons Learned

### HTML is the Skeleton
Hyper text markup language is meant to be the skeleton, as HTML is the foundation of every website. We build onto foundations but foundations can be plain and lackluster as they are only a piece of the puzzle. I look forward to learning CSS and using that knowledge to build off of this structure, creating style and enhancing layout.

### There are Many Ways to Do the Same Thing
Just as we have learned in Java that there are many correct ways to do a single task, that concept is also true in HTML. HTML without CSS does provide some challenges for creating a styled code but there are many ways to work around that in HTML. The strong and bold tag have the same result creating bolded letters that stand out just as the emphasize and italic tag both create italicized letters.

### Always Close Your Tags
HTML unlike Java won't fail to compile if you make a mistake. The mistake will show up, often in an usual place on the page. I found when I was not using Atoms auto-fill for HTML I had missed a few closing tags and this would lead to the pages structure being skewed as well as words or characters on the page that were not suppsoed ot be there.
